Farhan's reflection on the challenges faced and lessons learned during the process

One of my biggest challegnes of this entire process was time. HTML and CSS are not inherently challenging to learn but
to learn then to build a professional and functioning website felt like a lot. I dedicated a time everyday and still 
it took until the very last minutes to complete everything accordingly. Another big issue I ran into was formatting. 
Getting the images to one side and text to the other within a box without everything floating every took a lot.
I watched a lot of youtube videos on others doing it and to no avail. W3 schools helped a little but it really isn't
helpful for specific things you want to do. It teaches a lot of different things to do in HTML but whatever I am trying
to do is never there. This assignment was like learning the basics of swimming then being put into the deep end of a pool.


It did push me to learn a lot though that I will apply to future assignments!
